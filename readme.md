## Grafana Console for UberAgent data in Elasticsearch database

This github is a repository for Grafana consoles to gather Citrix data from MSSQL DB queries, and from Elasticsearch with an UberAgent index.  Check the [Windows_install](./Windows_Install.md) for information on how to get started with Elasticsearch and Grafana setup in Windows.

Import the Grafana Dashboards under MSSQL and Elasticsearch and point them to Datasources defined in your environment.  Then setup UberAgent to send data to your Elasticsearch instance and begin viewing data.

I will contine to add Dashboards to this console, and will add Azure Data locations in the future as well.
